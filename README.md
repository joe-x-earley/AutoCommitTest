## Examples

1. Create a Scratch org, deploy to it, run the tests and delete the Scratch org, every time we create a Pull Request to master.

```
name: Validate the Pull Request Changes

# Definition when the workflow should run
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master
    paths:
      - force-app/main/default/**

# Jobs to be executed
jobs:
  Deploy-to-Scratch-Org:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Checkout the code in the pull request
      - name: "Checkout source code"
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: 'Install Prerequisites'
        uses: engPabloMartinez/sf-deploy-github-actions/installRequirements@master

      - name: "Authenticate with DevHub"
        uses: engPabloMartinez/sf-deploy-github-actions/authenticate@master
        with:
          certificate_path: cert/server.key.enc
          certificate_key: ${{ secrets.CERTIFICATE_KEY }}
          certificate_iv: ${{ secrets.CERTIFICATE_IV }}
          app_client_id: ${{ secrets.PRODUCTION_APP_CONSUMER_KEY }}
          username: ${{ secrets.PRODUCTION_USERNAME }}
          org_type: "production"

      - name: "Create a Scratch Org"
        id: newScratchOrg
        uses: engPabloMartinez/sf-deploy-github-actions/scratchOrg/create@master
        with:
          scratch_definition_path: config/project-scratch-def.json

      - name: "Push changes to the Scratch Org"
        uses: engPabloMartinez/sf-deploy-github-actions/scratchOrg/push@master
        with:
          scratch_org_name: ${{ steps.newScratchOrg.outputs.scratch_org_name }}

      - name: "Run Tests on Scratch Org"
        uses: engPabloMartinez/sf-deploy-github-actions/scratchOrg/runTests@master
        with:
          scratch_org_name: ${{ steps.newScratchOrg.outputs.scratch_org_name }}

      - name: "Delete the Scratch Org"
        if: ${{ always() }}
        uses: engPabloMartinez/sf-deploy-github-actions/scratchOrg/delete@master
        with:
          scratch_org_name: ${{ steps.newScratchOrg.outputs.scratch_org_name }}
```

2. Deploy to Production when we tag a commit (tag starting with v) in master. This will validate the deployment and if it's successful it will do a quick deployment. After a successful deployment it will create a Github Release, adding the Release Notes from the commits.

```
name: Deployment to Production

# Definition when the workflow should run
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - v*
    paths:
      - force-app/main/default/**

# Jobs to be executed
jobs:
  Deploy-To-Production:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Checkout the code in the pull request
      - name: 'Checkout source code'
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: 'Install Prerequisites'
        uses: engPabloMartinez/sf-deploy-github-actions/installRequirements@master

      - name: 'Authenticate with Production'
        uses: engPabloMartinez/sf-deploy-github-actions/authenticate@master
        with:
          certificate_path: cert/server.key.enc
          certificate_key: ${{ secrets.CERTIFICATE_KEY }}
          certificate_iv: ${{ secrets.CERTIFICATE_IV }}
          app_client_id: ${{ secrets.PRODUCTION_APP_CONSUMER_KEY }}
          username: ${{ secrets.PRODUCTION_USERNAME }}
          org_type: 'production'

      - name: 'Validate the Package in Production Org'
        id: validatePackage
        uses: engPabloMartinez/sf-deploy-github-actions/validateOrDeploy@master
        with:
          package_path: manifest/package.xml
          test_level: 'RunLocalTests'
          org_type: 'production'

      - name: 'Deploy the Package to the Production Org'
        uses: engPabloMartinez/sf-deploy-github-actions/quickDeployment@master
        if: ${{ steps.validatePackage.outputs.job_id != '0' }}
        with:
          job_id: ${{ steps.validatePackage.outputs.job_id }}

  Create-Release:
    needs: [Deploy-To-Production]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Checkout the code in the pull request
      - name: 'Checkout source code'
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Create Release with Notes
        uses: actions/github-script@v5
        with:
          script: |
            github.rest.repos.createRelease({
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              tag_name: context.ref,
              name: `Release ${context.ref}`,
              draft: false,
              prerelease: false,
              generate_release_notes: true
            })
```

3. Run destructive changes (delete metadata) to a Sandbox when a destructiveChanges.xml is commited to master.

```
name: Destructive Changes to Sandbox

# Definition when the workflow should run
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
    paths:
      - destructiveChanges/destructiveChanges.xml

# Jobs to be executed
jobs:
  Deploy-to-Sandbox:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Checkout the code in the pull request
      - name: "Checkout source code"
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: 'Install Prerequisites'
        uses: engPabloMartinez/sf-deploy-github-actions/installRequirements@master

      - name: "Authenticate with Sandbox"
        uses: engPabloMartinez/sf-deploy-github-actions/authenticate@master
        with:
          certificate_path: cert/server.key.enc
          certificate_key: ${{ secrets.CERTIFICATE_KEY }}
          certificate_iv: ${{ secrets.CERTIFICATE_IV }}
          app_client_id: ${{ secrets.SANDBOX_APP_CONSUMER_KEY }}
          username: ${{ secrets.SANDBOX_USERNAME }}

      - name: "Deploy the Destructive Changes to Sandbox"
        uses: engPabloMartinez/sf-deploy-github-actions/validateOrDeploy@master
        with:
          package_path: destructiveChanges
          is_destructive: "true"
```
